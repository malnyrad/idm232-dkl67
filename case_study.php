            <h3>The Overview</h3>
            <p>This project, made for IDM 232 (Scripting for IDM II), was focused on serving as an introduction to PHP through creating an online recipe database.  Using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, this project aimed to deliver a smooth browsing and searching experience for users, tying together an intuitive front-end with a custom back-end database.  With a responsive interface and searchable content, the resulting website is an easy-to-navigate platform for users on their culinary journey.</p>

            <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>
            <p>This project was created for IDM-232 Scripting for IDM II. Over the course of 10 weeks, the purpose of this solo project was to build a dynamic website for hosting recipes where the end goal was to create a fully functional platform for users to browse and search for desired content. While we were provided the raw data to be used as content in our websites, it was up to me as the developer to translate that into a comprehensive database that could be interfaced with using PHP and MySQL. Ultimately, the final project was a product of everything I learned over the course of the term, including server-side scripting, database implementation, and best practices for safe coding.</p>
